| Average       | 60-74%   |
| Below Average | 40-59%   |
| Needs Work    | <40%     |

### CPL Interpretation

| CPL   | Performance       |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| <15   | Excellent         |
| 15-30 | Good              |

## Tips for Improvement

Based on your dashboard data:

1. **Low Accuracy**: Focus on taking more time per move, especially in critical
   positions

2. **High Blunder Rate**: Review your blunders to identify patterns (time
   pressure, specific piece types, board areas)

3. **Weak Opening**: Study basic opening principles and develop a repertoire

4. **Poor Endgame**: Practice basic endgame techniques (king activity, pawn
   promotion)

5. **Tactical Weakness**: Solve tactical puzzles daily to improve pattern
   recognition

## Data Privacy

All progress data is stored locally on your computer in the Chess-Sensei data
